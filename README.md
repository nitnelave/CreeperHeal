# CreeperHeal

CreeperHeal is a plugin for [Spigot](https://www.spigotmc.org/), a
[Minecraft](https://minecraft.net/) server implementation. It is available [on
the Spigot forums](https://www.spigotmc.org/resources/creeperheal.13346/).

The objective of the plugin is to keep Creepers interesting while protecting
your precious buildings and your pristine landscape. Creepers explode and cause
as much damage as usual, but after a while, the explosion starts to heal,
little by little. If you come around 5 minutes later, you wouldn't know a
Creeper was there!

CreeperHeal supports all kinds of explosions (including from other plugins), as
well as fire, and griefing prevention.

For more details, see the [Spigot project
page](https://www.spigotmc.org/resources/creeperheal.13346/), the 
[Wiki](https://github.com/nitnelave/CreeperHeal/wiki), or the 
[javadoc](http://nitnelave.github.io/CreeperHeal/apidoc/).
