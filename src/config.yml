#Feel free to test the settings for "replacement" and the worlds
#but I advise against changing the "advanced" section if you don't know exactly what you're doing
#
#
#
#
#This first section is about how the blocks are goind to get replaced
#
#
replacement:
#   How many seconds before the explosion/burnt block starts healing
  wait-before-heal:
    explosions: 60
    fire: 45
#   if block-per-block is disabled, all the blocks of an explosion will be replaced at the same time
  block-per-block:
    enabled: true
    interval: 20
#  If true, the bricks destroyed by an explosion will come back as cracked
  crack-destroyed-bricks: false
#  can be 'no', 'lwc', 'lockette' or 'all' : protects the concerned chests from every explosion
  chest-protection: 'no'
