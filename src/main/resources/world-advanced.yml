# Advanced world-specific settings
#
# restrict: Prevent replacement of some blocks. If use-whitelist is true, then
# only the blocks listed in the whitelist are replaced, otherwise every block
# except those listed in the blacklist are replaced.  The format to enter a
# block is ID:DATA, with the data being optional. The
# values are separated by comas. If no data is specified, then all data values
# are included. For example, to block dirt, all types of wool, normal logs and
# birch logs : 3, 35, 17:0, 17:2
#
# replace-grass-with-dirt: If true, then grass blocks that are blown up will be
# replaced by plain dirt blocks.
#
# repair-time-of-day: Minecraft time at which every explosion and burnt block
# should be replaced. (-1 to deactivate)
# Sunrise is around 23000, noon 6000, sunset 13000, and midnight 18000. Day
# (zombies burning) starts at 0.
#
# protected-list: List of block types to protect (in the same format as the
# restrict lists).
#
# factions: To use with the Factions plugin. If the settings are set to true,
# the explosions in wilderness or territory are ignored by CreeperHeal (blocks
# are destroyed normally).
